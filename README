Search Engine Database (SEDB)
     SEDB contains an information about search engines. WWW::Promotion will use 
     this information to submit your URL.

     SEDB it is a directory which contains files. Each file contains
     an information about one search engine. Files has various names and may
     reside in different subdirectories inside SEDB. This files has the following 
     format:

     POST http://www.rex-search.com/add/add.cgi HTTP/1.0
     Content: thispage=3&catnum=&url=<***URL***>&navigate=&yourname=<***CONTACTNAME***>&email=<***EMAIL***>&name=<***TITLE***>&keys=<***KEYWORDS***>&desc=<***DESCRIPTION***>&confirm=&urlfail=&refer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rex-search.com%2Fadd%2F&cat=<***CATEGORY***>&catkeep=Submit+this+Site

     Or

     GET http://www.ditto.com/urlrequest/AddResponse.asp?txtUserName=<***CONTACTNAME***>&txtURL=<***URL***>&txtEmail=<***EMAIL***>&submit1=Submit&xfrm=True&cs=AddRemoveURL&ac=AddRemoveURL&Action=Add HTTP/1.0

     The first line describes which method to use for submit. Also it
     contains the address where to post data. "HTTP/1.0" in this line unessential,
     WWW::Promotion will ignore it. This line is required, without it the module
     will log a bad file and process the next file. For method POST it is required 
     second line (Content:), which contains search engine cantent data. In method 
     GET content is placed in the first line through "?". In a case if the address 
     contains a relative address it is required third line (Host:), which describes 
     which address of server to use for connect.

     Also the file may contain unessential lines:

     Referer: http://www.ditto.com/urlrequest/addurl.asp
     Inform the module to use this referer. Advanced technology, the engines 
     "think" you are submitting from their form. 

     Host: www.ditto.com
     Inform the module which server to use for connect. It is required only when
     the first line contains a relative address on a server 
     (for example " GET / HTTP/1.0 ").

     Country: United States
     Country of the search engine. WWW::Promotion uses this info for OutputHandler.

     SEname: Magellan
     Name of the search engine. WWW::Promotion uses this info for OutputHandler.

     SEurl: http://www.url.com
     URL of the search engine. WWW::Promotion uses this info for  OutputHandler.

     Server: Netscape-Enterprise/2.01
     The software which is used in the search engine.
     WWW::Promotion uses this info for OutputHandler.

     Category: SEcat-Internet <***> Internet
     Category: SEcat-Business <***> Business
     Categories determined in the search engine. These lines may be more 
     than one. Format:
     Category: (a category of the search engine)<***>(an internal category of the module).
     The module will search for conformity of an internal category with a category 
     of a search engine. If you for example have defined an internal category "Other",
     the module will search for line "Category: SEcat <***> Other" and
     will use the category "SEcat" for submit. In a case if it does not find
     the appropriate category it will use first of determined.
     (Category:) it is required only when a content contains a key 
     <***CATEGORY***>. See below.

     The content contains keys which in process of submiting of your URL will be 
     replaced with the data, which you have entered. The following keys can be used
